# GPUThreadFP

## Learn indirect memory access patterns of GPU threads

### To-do: 
* ~~Visualize address space~~ - Done  
* ~~Cluster address space by threads/blocks~~ - Done
* ~~Seperate Indirect accesses~~ - Done
* Calculate input and output deltas - Might not be required 
* ~~Apply LSTM~~ 
* ~~Apply LSTM on clustered space~~ 

### Potential: 
* Imitation learning
* Ensemble models
* Using beam search 
* Hierarchical softmax
