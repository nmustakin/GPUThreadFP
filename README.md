# GPUThreadFP

## Learn indirect memory access patterns of GPU threads

### To-do: 
* ~~Visualize address space~~ Each address occurs only once, address space is contiguous  
* ~~Cluster address space by threads/blocks~~ Contiguous address space
* ~~Seperate Indirect accesses~~ no way to differentiate
* Calculate input and output deltas 
* Apply LSTM 
* ~~Apply LSTM on clustered space~~

### Potential: 
* Imitation learning
* Ensemble models
* Using beam search 
* Hierarchical softmax
